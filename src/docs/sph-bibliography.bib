  abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to Smoothed Particle
	Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice.
	Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing
	how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived
	from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations
	using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle
	difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In
	doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in
	particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number'
	more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain
	convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities
	such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical
	advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing
	the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks
	and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we
	give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying
	the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a
	1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms
	that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of
	the numerical examples contained in the paper.},
